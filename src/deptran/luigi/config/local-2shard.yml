# Luigi 2-Shard Local Test Configuration
# Compatible with janus::Config parser

# site - partition map
# Each line is a partition (shard)
# First item in each partition is the leader (locale_id=0 means role=0)
site:
  server:
    - ["s101:31850"]   # Shard 0 leader
    - ["s201:31851"]   # Shard 1 leader
  client:
    - ["c101"]

# site_name -> process_name map
# IMPORTANT: Use "localhost" to get role=0 (leader) in Config parsing
# Config assigns role based on proc_name: localhost=0, learner=2, else=1
process:
  s101: localhost
  s201: localhost
  c101: localhost

# process_name -> host_addr map
