# Luigi 2-Shard Local Test Configuration
# Compatible with janus::Config parser

# site - partition map
# Each line is a partition (shard)
# First item in each partition is the leader (locale_id=0 means role=0)
site:
  server:
    - ["s101:31850"]   # Shard 0 leader
    - ["s201:31851"]   # Shard 1 leader
  client:
    - ["c101"]

# site_name -> process_name map
# Each shard has its own process name for independent deployment
# In production, these would be different physical machines
process:
  s101: localhost0
  s201: localhost1
  c101: localhost

# process_name -> host_addr map
# For local testing, both map to 127.0.0.1
# In production, these would be different IPs
host:
  localhost0: 127.0.0.1
  localhost1: 127.0.0.1
  localhost: 127.0.0.1
